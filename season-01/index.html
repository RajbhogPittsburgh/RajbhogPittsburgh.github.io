<p>
In this live cooking class, we will make Indian Chai. For many Indians, chai is their "Coke-a-Cola". In our class today, we'll take a look at a few types of chais, how to make them, and why you might want to enjoy one variety over another (besides the taste). 
</p>

<p>
Before we get started, let's talk about the American vernacular "Chai Tea" which is never right. Since 'Chai' mean 'Tea', "Chai Tea" means 'tea-tea', which &#x2026;. well, let's leaver that alone and move on.
</p>

<p>
In this class, we will look at making the following types and flavors of chai:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">

<div id="outline-container-orgf34cca9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgf34cca9">Ginger</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf34cca9">
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Nausea</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ginger has long been used as a potentially preventive measure for motion sickness and seasickness. A study published in Nutrition Journal reveals that ginger may help in relieving nausea during pregnancy, but was not seen to be as effective in treating problems of vomiting. Significantly, it did not show any side-effect, an important factor when treating pregnant women. [6]
</p>

<p>
Its quick absorption and rapid regulation of body functions cure nausea in people who have undergone surgeries, without any side effects. Nausea is also a symptom of migraine. By curing it, ginger can also help in managing migraines.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Cold and Flu</li>
</ol>
<p>
This is traditionally used in many Asian countries against cold and flu. A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology found that fresh ginger shows potential antiviral properties against respiratory tract infections. It can be used in the form of tea for providing relief to sore throat and coughing.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Aid in Digestion</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ginger finds a prominent mention in Chinese medicine as a facilitator of the digestive process. While many of its benefits are established part of traditional medicinal history, a review published in 2019 in the journal Food, Science &amp; Nutrition asked for more human studies to understand effective dosage. The study, however, agreed that there was substantial anecdotal evidence, backed by clinical trials. [8]
</p>

<p>
It is also frequently used as an appetizer or an aperitif since it can stimulate the appetite while preparing the digestive system for an influx of food. It works well as a carminative, thus helping with flatulence. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Remedial in Stomach Ulcers</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ginger may prevent the occurrence of ulcers, which are generally characterized by bleeding and acute gastric irritability. According to a study published in 2016 in the World Journal of Gastrointestinal Pharmacology and Therapeutics, it is very effective in inhibiting the growth of H. pylori bacteria, which is ulcerogenic, thus keeping your stomach healthy. 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Arthritis Pain</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ginger is known to boost bone health and relieve joint pain associated with arthritis. It may contain gingerol, which has powerful anti-inflammatory properties. It can improve movement in osteoarthritis, knee inflammation, and rheumatoid arthritis, as cited in a study published in Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism journal. Along with that, it also suppresses the inflammatory compounds like cytokines and chemokines at the source before they begin to affect the body.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Relieve Asthma</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ginger has been used traditionally as a potential medicine to treat respiratory disorders. Recent studies have also seconded its potential anti-inflammatory property. Zerumbone, an active compound, may help relieve asthma. Research shows that allergic airway inflammation is majorly caused by Th2 dominance and the spicy root is successfully able to suppress it.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Liver Protection</li>
</ol>
<p>
People suffering from tuberculosis can benefit from ginger, as it helps prevent hepatotoxicity. Animal studies show that it also protects against the liver-damaging cadmium poisoning caused due to the significant ingestion of cadmium. Its essential oil exerts a protective effect against the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease occurring because of obesity.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Weight Loss</li>
</ol>
<p>
Animal studies show that ginger can aid in accelerating weight loss and managing obesity by helping boost your metabolism. It may increase exercise endurance capacity so that you work out well and get back into shape to fit in that outfit you were so excited to wear.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Improve Cognition</li>
</ol>
<p>
Research suggests that ginger could delay the onset of neurodegenerative diseases like dementia, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. According to a study published in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, ginger improved cognitive function in middle-aged healthy women. This shows that it can be used to improve cognitive decline among the elderly.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Relieve Muscle Pain</li>
</ol>
<p>
Ginger is well-known for reducing muscle pain and soreness caused due to exercising. The potentially anti-inflammatory properties of this root are to be credited for this benefit. The study points out that ‘daily consumption of raw and heat-treated ginger resulted in moderate-to-large reductions in muscle pain following exercise-induced muscle injury.

<div id="outline-container-org371cad9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org371cad9">Cardamom</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org371cad9">
<p>
<a href="https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/health-benefits-of-cardamom.html">Organic Facts</a>
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Antimicrobial Properties</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cardamom was regarded to possess infection-fighting properties.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to ancient herbal treatments against harmful bacteria, modern antibiotics have been found to produce side effects such as inhibition of good bacteria in the intestines. While spices such as cardamom may not be as consistently powerful, they inhibit only infectious microbes, not beneficial probiotics. [7]
</p>

<p>
This theory was tested in experiments with its extracts. The oils from cardamom were able to inhibit the growth and spread of dangerous microbes that may be a cause of food poisoning. [8] [9] [10]
</p>

<p>
Studies have also suggested that cardamom may also have the potential to become an alternative therapy against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. [11]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Improved Heart Health</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cardamom may be protective against many heart conditions.
</p>

<p>
According to a study published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, when male albino rats were administered with 100-200 mg of cardamom extract, there was a significant improvement witnessed in their cardiac and left ventricular functions. This means that the spice helped in regulating blood pressure in these rats. [12]
</p>

<p>
Moreover, studies conducted on individuals with stage 1 hypertension also show that cardamom proved effective in reducing high blood pressure. [13]
</p>

<p>
In an animal study published in the International Journal of Experimental Biology, antioxidant enzymes from cardamom may have been found to protect the heart from oxidation and control cholesterol levels despite a high-fat diet. [14] [15]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Anti-inflammatory Properties</li>
</ol>
<p>
Evidence suggests that certain compounds in cardamom may have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. A 2010 report suggests that black pepper and cardamom extracts may help in building a healthy immune system. [16] [17]
</p>

<p>
Research has found these properties to be protective when inflammation and oxidative stress are caused by unhealthy weight and diet. [18] [19]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Improved Digestive Health</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cardamom has been traditionally used in Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and the Unani system as a remedy for digestive problems. It may have carminative and stomachic properties. [20]
</p>

<p>
The methanolic extract from cardamom is the component that may help in controlling gastrointestinal discomforts such as acidity, flatulence, and stomach cramps. [21]
</p>

<p>
A study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology concluded that the extracted volatile oils from cardamom may have a positive influence on gastric ulcers. It is also found to offer protect against Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium linked to stomach ulcers, says a study published in the Phytotherapy Research. [22] [23]Cardamom has been traditionally used in Ayurveda, Chinese medicine, and the Unani system as a remedy for digestive problems. It may have carminative and stomachic properties. [20]

</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Regulates Blood Sugar</li>
</ol>
<p>
Studies show that antioxidants derived from plants may help in keeping away diabetes and cardamom has been used for the same in many countries.
</p>

<p>
To analyze the effectiveness of this remedy, researchers conducted various studies and found that cardamom does help in lowering your risk of diabetes mellitus. Although, the mechanism is different.
</p>

<p>
Laboratory studies have found cardamom to help in regulating glucose and insulin levels through inhibition of digestive enzymes. The loss of the activity of these enzymes produces a reduction of starch and protein digestion. [24]
</p>

<p>
According to a 2017 research, cardamom may even improve inflammation and oxidative stress in hyperlipidemic obese pre‐diabetic women.
</p>

<p>
More research is still required for this. [25]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Oral Health</li>
</ol>
<p>
In ancient times, people used cardamom for treating various oral conditions. [26]
</p>

<p>
Research has verified the presence of antimicrobial properties in cardamom, which may help fight common bacteria linked to cavities. [27]
</p>

<p>
It is also an ingredient in a traditional mouth rinse used to prevent dental plaque. Moreover, cardamom may have antimicrobial properties that could help get rid of dental caries. [28] [29]
</p>

<p>
Cardamom pods and seeds may also be chewed as a breath freshener, and its essential oil is a popular ingredient in chewing gum. [30]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Liver Health</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cardamom may have beneficial effects on the liver.
</p>

<p>
Research suggests that cardamom extracts may show hepatoprotective properties in people with elevated cholesterol levels, triglycerides, and liver inflammation. These extracts may also have the potential to lower the risk of liver diseases. [31]
</p>

<p>
Studies also suggest that it can help in lowering the effects of toxicity or damage caused by antibiotics like gentamicin. [32]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Mind and Relaxation</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cardamom is believed to possess anti-depressant properties. [33]
</p>

<p>
Its essential oil is one of the major oils used in aromatherapy and has been suggested in human research to be an effective choice for handling stressful conditions. [34]
</p>

<p>
Also, a 2016 research published by a team of scientists has found cardamom extract to may be lower PTSD-like anxiety symptoms in test animals. [35]
</p>

<p>
One study published in the Saudi Journal of Biological Sciences found that when cardamom was consumed by mice during pregnancy, their offspring showed enhanced learning, memory, and behavior. However, more research is required to ascertain the benefits of this spice on other kinds of behavior. [36]
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Respitory Health</li>
</ol>
<p>
Cardamom may have also shown positive potential against respiratory problems.
</p>

<p>
According to a study published in the Bangladesh Journal of Pharmacology, it was shown to be effective in opening closed windpipes in laboratory animals, as well as protection against inhalation injury in the lungs of mice. [37]

Evidence also shows that inhaling cardamom essential oil has been found to increase blood circulation and oxygen uptake during exercise. [38]
</p>

<p>
The spice extract was found to have components that may protect the blood from clogging vessels and leading to problems such as heart attack and stroke. [39]

<li>Nausea and Vomiting</li>
</ol>
<p>
Traditionally, cardamom may have been used as a remedy for nausea and may be able to calm the urge to vomit. Consuming cardamom powder was observed to lessen the severity of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy, according to a study published in the International Journal of Preventive Medicine. Alternatively, aromatherapy with cardamom oil may also help relieve nausea. [40] [41] [42]

<p>
First, take your time to cook tea and enjoy the process.
</p>

<p>
To start, pour water in to the sauce pan, add the tea and masala. Begin heating the water on high heat. While the water is coming to a boil, use motar and pestal to crush the cardamom pods to break open and further crush the seeds. When you get to a coarse powder, introduce the cardamom powder to the water.
</p>

<p>
Then, by hand, crush the mint leaves to small parts directly into the saucepan. The leaves will release mint oil and water moisture.
</p>

<p>
Next, use a fine greater to grate the ginger root. Ginger may contain a lot of moisture, so you will have a small mound of ginger fiber. Add all of the ginger fiber to the water.
</p>

<p>
BONUS: if you are adventurous, add the three strands of saffron to the mixture for both color and it's excellent anti-oxidant benefits.
</p>

<p>
When the water begins to boil, take note of the time. You will boil the water for nearly 1 minute to allow all of the spices to be fully consumed into the mixture.
</p>

<p>
This is a good time to talk about ginger and cardamom!
</p>

<p>
After one minuite of boiling, add the milk to the pan and allow it to come to a boil.
</p>

<p>
Water evaporation from milk is slower and milk malai on top acts as an insultor, the milk in the bottom and middle of the pan will continue to boil to the point it can boil over the pan. For this, turn down the stove to a simmer and allow the tea to cool. When this happens, use a spoon to scoop the top layer of malai off being careful not to remove too much of the spices. Of course, by this time, the spices have been fully introduced to the tea, so removing some of the spices will not lessen the affect.
</p>

<p>
Turn the stove back to full heat and allow the tea to come back to boil. Once again, turn the stove to simmer.
</p>

<p>
Repoeat this process so the tea has boiled 3 times.
</p>

<p>
At this time, use a ladel to continue mixing the spices into the tea. This step is important and often rushed through. By lifting the ladel out of the saucepan and allowing the tea to pour back in, you are oxiginating the tea. This is the same process as aeratring wine. 
</p>

<p>
If you find the color of the tea is too light or too much water has boiled off, this is the perfect time to add more loose leaf tea or room-temperature water. If you use cold water, let the tea come back to boil once more.
</p>

<p>
Bring the stove back to simmer. Now the tea is ready for our enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
Use a fine strainer to pour the tea into your cup.
</p>

<p>
As a last step, you want to break the cinnamon stick into a small part and add it to your chai for both its health benefits and as a garnishment.
